<br>I have been passionate about art and painting since the age of 12. Creating on canvas brings me a sense of peace and fulfillment, making it a form of therapy during my free time. Additionally, I enjoy visiting art museums and expos, where I am captivated by the stories behind each piece and the beauty they embody. It's a delightful and enriching experience that fuels my passion for art even further.

In addition to art, I find pleasure in various activities during my free time. Exploring the streets of Barcelona while listening to music on my headphones is one of my favorite pastimes, it has often inspired me to overcome challenges and generate fresh ideas for my projects. I also enjoy spending time with friends, working out at the gym, and occasionally indulging in gaming, although I must admit, I am more of a casual gamer and my skills are not at an expert level.


## My Plant

I've never had a plant before, but this is a really special gift from someone I truly love. While I may not be an expert in gardening, I will try my best to ensure it grows healthy and beautiful.
